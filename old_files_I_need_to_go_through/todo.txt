In no particular order (though vaguely ordered in terms of "maybe this is
easiest" first), stuff I'd like to get around to (but probably never will):

Python and/or the entire stack:
- [ ] Fork of musicazoo, and add the current changes to it.
- [x] Reproduce and fix whatever the problems are?
- [ ] Ansible-ize everything? (NixOS-ize everything? :P)
- [ ] Non MP4 downloads.
- [x] Video speed manipulation.
- [ ] Download percentage, since they're sooooo slow now (why? is this an MIT
      network thing?).
- [ ] Video subtitles (download them too).
- [ ] Allow some non-youtube things (vimeo would be nice to have).
- [ ] Websockets support, not just polling.
- [ ] Better disk-full-ness protection.
- [ ] Queueing up a playlist.
- [ ] Live streams.

The webpage:
- [ ] Make it look... slightly more decent.
- [ ] "DOM diffing" to not replace all the HTML every time.
    - https://github.com/google/incremental-dom looks fancy
